Hello world!! In this post I'll try to explain a little what’s this blog/page is about.

{: .text-justify}
Well, basically this website is to showcase my personal projects, [checkout the portfolio page](/portfolio/), and to write some devlogs about my upcoming, and most ambitious, project, a game engine from scratch. I’ll not enter in details about that because it is something that I’m planning to write in the devlogs.

Also, just a heads up, probably my updates are going to be very slow, and mostly updates will be in the portfolio page, and for that I'm planning to do an "autoupdater" in python, [link](https://github.com/eHonnef/personal-site-updater-py).

BTW, the template for this website is available at [Minimal-Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and if you want to use my template, I did some modifications, specially in the portfolio page to categorize those items, [this is the link](https://github.com/eHonnef/ehonnef.github.io), just fork it and be happy :D.

If you want to contact me, all my links and contact info are in the sidebar.

Bye (:
